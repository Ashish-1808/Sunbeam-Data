MVC development Steps
1. Create new project(eg online voting) | continue with HealthCare - patient view

2. Good MVC practice
- DO NOT give Client , a direct access to the view layer
- Copy the JSPs under
 - <WEB-INF>/views.

3. Configure welcome page as 
- <WEB-INF>/views/login.jsp

4. After submitting the form 
URI - /ctx_path/login
