Day 1
1. Today's work

Everyone MUST 
- create 2 servlets
- first one deploy using xml tags
- second deploy with annotation
- first one - lazy
- second one - eager.

Web development Steps
1. Download , extract , STS 4 .
For Mac Users 
- refer to "day1_data\day1_help\Adding Web developer tools in STS 4 for Mac Users.txt"
Perform these steps.
Then continue with remaining steps .
2. Download & Extract Apache Tomcat Web server 
- "web java prerequisites\Web Server n Jakarta EE docs\apache-tomcat-10.1.26.7z"
- Save it under Study Materials | Software folder 
- Add tomcat server to web java STS 4 workspace.
How ? 

Steps
1. Change the perspective to Java EE
 Window -> Perspective -> Change Perspective -> Other -> Java EE
2. Choose Servers
 - It will show you - NO servers
3. Click on the link
 - Choose Apache vendor & select Apache Tomcat 10.1
4. Next -> Browse & Choose Tomcat Installation directory (Tomcat Home)
5. Confirm JRE - JDK 21
6. Finish
7. Choose Apache Tomcat & start it. 
8. Launch Server console & see if Tomcat is up & running.
9. Create a dynamic web project ,to deploy monolithic web app (server side will render the view :HTTP  response content type : text/html)
10. Configure web.xml , with welcome file list.
11. Add index.html : welcome page (home page) with welcome message

12. Start Server side application
Right click on web project -> Run as -> Servler side app -> choose server -> finish
You can check the server console.

IDE will automatically launch chrome (default web browser) & send a request to the web application.

eg : 
Request URL - http://localhost:8080/day1.1
response  : index.html will be rendered.

13. Create servlets & test.


Day 2
In the combined Lab 
1. import day2.2 , in the workspace 
 - as existing Java Project
 - Edit DB password from DBUtils

2. We will walk through the entire code & revise along with Inspect tools

Mandatory Assignment 
3. Solve 
Refer to 
- "day2_data\day2_help\HTML pages\calc.html

Write a Calculator Servlet , to render the result of the specified operation.
- Servlet should be deployed using annotation

Day 3

1. import day3.1 , in the workspace 
 - as existing Java Project
 - Edit DB password from DBUtils

2. Complete code walk through, 
- from login to logout

3. Later 
-revise it on your own & ask questions tomorrow.

4. Complete pending work.
(Mandatory)

5. Optional assignment I
Add Cancel Link in Patient Dashoard page.

Day 4
Revise First
1. import day4.1 
- Healthcare case study (Patient view)
 - added cancel appointment feature

2. import day4.2 
-Revise 
- DB independent web application using ServletConfig
Refer 
web.xml
DBUtils
UserDaoImpl
AuthenticationServlet

3. IMPORTANT
import day4.3 
-To Revise 
-Request Dispatching
 - forward
 - include

4. import day4.4 
- It's complete Healthcare case study  . with more details.
-To Revise
- Web application event listener
- Confirmation of thread pool based concurrency

Solve Mandatory Assignment
1. Solve 
Refer to 
- "day2_data\day2_help\HTML pages\calc.html

Write a Calculator Servlet , to only COMPUTE  the result of the specified operation.
Store - operands(numbers), operation & result in to java object (Hint - attribute) 
Then forward the client to DisplayServlet & render result.

2. After understanding forward , replace forward by include 
- Spot the differences.



Day 5

1. import day5_jsp , in your workspace.
We will revise basic JSP syntax
- scripting elements 
- page directive

2. Solve JSP assignment
"day5_data\JSP basic assignment.png"


Day 6

Mandatory work 

1. Download & extract 
"Template Projects\hibernate_template.7z"
1.1 import "hibernate_template" as existing Maven Project in your workspace.

Steps
From STS4 IDE
 File - import - Maven -Existing Maven Project - Browse -
template projects\hibernate_template
Finish

Refer - "day6_data\day6_help\hibernate help\screenshot-0.png"

1.2 Force update the Maven , to download the dependencies. 

Right click on the project - Maven - Update Project - select the check box 'Force Update'

Refer - "day6_data\day6_help\hibernate help\screenshot-1.png"

You need a stable net connection here to download dependencies.
This will create Maven local repository folder (under user home /.m2) - 1st time only .
It will download hibernate dependencies(hibernate JARs , mysql connector jar) and cache it under Maven local repository.
Then onwards you don't need a net connection (till spring !)

1.3 Right click on the project - Run As - Maven Build . 
- Add goals as
- clean compile
Run .
Refer to screenshot
"day6_data\day6_help\hibernate help\screenshot-2.png"
"day6_data\day6_help\hibernate help\screenshot-3.png"


2. import day6.1 , to revise 
- JSP basic assignment solution , with URL rewriting
- JSP include directive
- JSP forward & include actions

3. import healthcare_mvc 
- For custom implementation of MVC pattern
(It's still incomplete)
- Do refer to 
login.jsp
AuthenticationServlet

Refer for CCEE
"day6_data\day6_help\mvc-help\Regarding MVC.txt"
"day6_data\day6_help\mvc-help\diagrams\MVC implementation flow.png"
"day6_data\day6_help\mvc-help\diagrams\why mvc.png"

4. Optional weekend assignment
Complete fresh scenario
